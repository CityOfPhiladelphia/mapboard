# mapboard

_(work in progress)_

Mapboard provides a pluggable Vue.js component for data-rich mapping applications. It combines the look and feel of [Atlas]() with a more flexible, config-driven API.

## Deployment

To push a new version of Mapboard:

1. Commit your changes to `master`.
2. Bump the NPM version with `npm version major|minor|patch`.
3. Push with tags: `git push --tags`.

Travis will now run a build and publish to NPM.
